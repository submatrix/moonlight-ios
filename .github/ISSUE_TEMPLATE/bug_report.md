**READ ME FIRST!**
If you're here because something basic is not working (like gamepad input, video, or similar), it's probably something specific to your setup, so make sure you've gone through the Troubleshooting Guide first: https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Troubleshooting

If you still have trouble with basic functionality after following the guide, join our Discord server where there are many other volunteers who can help (or direct you back here if it looks like a Moonlight bug after all). https://moonlight-stream.org/discord
